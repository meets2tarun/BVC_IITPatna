<b>Translation</b>: Glorification of the Supreme Personality of Godhead is performed in 
the paramparaa system, that is, it is conveyed from the spiritual master to disciple.
 Such glorification is relished by those no longer interested in the false, temporary 
 glorification of this cosmic manifestation. Descriptions of the Lord are the right medicine
  for the conditioned soul undergoing repeated birth and death. Therefore, who will cease 
  hearing such glorification of the Lord except a butcher or one who is killing his own self?
<p>
In the Western countries, when someone sees the cover of a book like Krishna, he immediately 
asks, Who is Krishna? Who is the girl with Krishna? etc.
<p>
The immediate answer is that Krishna is the Supreme Personality of Godhead. How is that? Because
 He conforms in
exact detail to descriptions of the Supreme Being, the Godhead. In other words, Krishna is the 
Godhead because He is all attractive. Outside the principle of all attraction, there is no 
meaning to the word  Godhead. How is it one can be all attractive? First of all, if one is 
very
<br>

 wealthy, if he has great riches, he becomes attractive to the people in general. Similarly,
  if someone is very powerful, he also becomes attractive, and if someone is very famous, 
  he also becomes attractive, and if someone is very beautiful or wise or unattached to 
  all kinds of possessions, he also becomes attractive. So from practical experience we 
  can observe that one is attractive due to (1) wealth, (2) power, (3) fame, (4) beauty, 
  (5) wisdom and (6) renunciation. One who is in possession of all six of these opulences
   at the same time, who possesses them to an unlimited degree, is
understood to be the Supreme Personality of Godhead. These opulences of the Godhead are
 delineated by Paraasara Muni, a great Vedic authority.
<p>We have seen many rich persons, many powerful persons, many famous persons, many beautiful
 persons, many learned and scholarly persons, and persons in the renounced order of life 
 unattached to material possessions. But we have never seen any one person who is
  unlimitedly and simultaneously 
wealthy, powerful, famous, beautiful, wise and unattached, like Krishna, in the history of 
humanity. Krishna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, is a historical person who appeared
 on this earth 5,000 years ago. He stayed on this earth for 125 years and played exactly like
  a human being, but His activities were unparalleled. From the very moment of His appearance 
  to the moment of His disappearance, every one of His activities is unparalleled in the history
   of the world, and therefore anyone who knows what we mean by Godhead will accept Krishna as the
    Supreme Personality of Godhead. No one is equal to the Godhead, and no one is greater than Him.
     That is the import of the familiar saying God is great.
<p>There are various classes of men in the world who speak of God in different ways, but according
 to the Vedic literatures and according to the great aacharyas, the authorized persons versed in
  the
knowledge of God in all ages, like aacharyas sanskara, Raamanuja, Madhva, Vishnu Svaami, Lord Chaitanya
 and all their followers by disciplic succession, all unanimously agree that Krishna is the Supreme
  Personality of Godhead. As far as we, the followers of Vedic civilization, are concerned, 
  we accept the Vedic history of the whole universe, which consists of different planetary systems,
   called Svargaloka, or the higher planetary system, Martyaloka, or the intermediary planetary 
   system, and Paataalaloka, or the lower planetary system. The modern historians of this earth 
   cannot supply historical evidences of events that occurred before 5,000 years ago, and the
    anthropologists say that 40,000 years ago Homo sapiens had not appeared on this planet
     because evolution had not reached that point. But the Vedic histories, such as the 
     Puranas and Mahaabhaarata, relate human histories which extend millions and billions of 
     years into the past.
<p>For example, from these literatures we are given the histories of Krishna's appearances 
and disappearances millions and billions of years ago. In the Fourth Chapter of the Bhagavad gitaa
 Krishna tells Arjuna that both He and Arjuna had had many births before and that He (Krishna) 
 could remember all of them but Arjuna could not. This illustrates the difference between the 
 knowledge of Krishna and that of Arjuna. Arjuna might have been a very great warrior, a 
 well cultured member of the Kuru dynasty, but after all, he was an ordinary human being, 
 whereas Krishna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, is the possessor of unlimited knowledge. 
 Because He possesses unlimited knowledge, Krishna has a memory that is boundless.
<p>Krishna's knowledge is so perfect that He remembers all the incidents of His appearances 
some millions and billions of years in the past, but Arjuna's memory and knowledge are limited 
by time and space, for he is an ordinary human being. In the Fourth Chapter Krishna states that
 He can remember instructing the lessons of the Bhagavad gitaa some millions of years ago to
  the sungod, Vivasvaan.
<p>Nowadays it is the fashion of the atheistic class of men to try to become God by following
 some mystic process. Generally the atheists claim to be God by dint of their imagination or 
 their meditational prowess. Krishna is not that kind of God. He does not become God by 
 manufac-turing some mystic process of meditation, nor does He become God by undergoing the severe
  austerities of the mystic yogic exercises. Properly speaking, He never becomes God because He 
  is the Godhead in all circumstances.
<p>Within the prison of His maternal uncle Kansa, where His father and mother were confined, 
Krishna appeared outside His mother's body as the four handed Visnu Naarayana.
 Then He turned Himself into a baby and told His father to carry Him to the house of
  Nanda Mahaaraja and his wife Yasodaa. When Krishna was just a small baby the gigantic 
  demoness Putana attempted to kill Him, but when He sucked her breast He pulled out her 
  life. That is the difference between the real Godhead and a God manufactured in the mystic
   factory. Krishna had no chance to practice the mystic yoga process, yet He manifested 
   Himself as the Supreme Personality of Godhead at every step, from infancy to childhood, 
   from childhood to boyhood, and from boyhood to young manhood.
